    Utility function which compresses feature vectors from an input image dictionary into a matrix for processing.

    Parameters:
        input_dict: An input dictionary where the keys are filenames and the values are dictionaries with information
            about each image (feature vector, subject, type, etc.)
        model: The feature model used to compute the feature vectors ('color', 'elbp', 'hog', or 'latent').

        An array where feature vectors are stacked into an array row-wise in the SAME order as images in the feature dictionary.

    Parameters:

    To determine the distance for the color moment feature descriptor, Euclidean distance is used.

    'difficult' it is to convert between the histograms. The sum of the EM distance
    for all histograms in a feature vector is returned as the distance value.
    Parameters:
        vector_1: The first input vector. This should be a 1-dimensional array.
        vector_2: The second input vector. This should be a 1-dimensional array equal in size to the first.
